<h1>Outfitted Hunts</h1>

<p>I have a few select outfitters that I have confidence in and will book hunters with the one that suits their needs.
  Make no mistake there is a huge value to the services a good outfitter has to offer.
  Not everyone has the time or ability to pack in their own gear and pack out elk on their backs.
  Some just don't care to. When do it yourself hunters kill elk the work can really begin.
  Often this means down time for you and your partners and for everyone in a party to kill a bull may just not be realistic.
  When using an outfitter this isn't the case as you can kill an elk and everyone can continue to hunt.
  If your hunt includes meals than you can truly just eat, sleep and hunt.
  Not the case for DIY hunters who must take care of camp chores such as cooking and cleaning up as well as setting up and breaking down camp.
  Though they may save you a few bucks there is a considerable amount of extra time needed to pull off a do it yourself hunt.
  Especially a successful one! The real bonus for those who choose a DIY hunt is the satisfaction of knowing you did it completely on your own.

<p>There are several types of hunts offered by the outfitters I recommend.
  Fully guided, drop camps, or outfitted DIY where you have a camp, meals, and maybe even a day or two with a guide, but also time afield on your own.
  Some outfitters have very nice 4 star camps. Some have great hunting in remote wilderness where camps can be more primitive.
  If you are interested in a quality outfitted hunt call or email and I will set you up with an outfitter that best suit your needs.
  The difference between me and most hunting consultants or plain old booking agents is that I personally know my outfitters and have guided for them or hunted their areas on my own.
  I'm much more than just a middle man!
